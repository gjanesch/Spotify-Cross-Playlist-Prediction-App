This contains code for an app designed to make song recommendations from a Spotify playlist based on the contents of another.

Writeups going into more detail can be found here.

Requires the tidyverse and Plotly.  Does not rely on spotifyr, as it was temporarily unavailable while I coded this up, though it does copy several functions from it.

NOTE: The file "client_info.R" contains the API keys for accessing Spotify, and as such is not included in this repository; you'll need to generate your own.
